Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing Tumblr's API to search and gather data from the Newsweek's Tumblr blog.
- the code will extract information by searching for photo and text posts.
- for the photo posts, the code will search for 20 posts for these information : (id, timestamp, tags, url, dimensions (width x height), captions and note count.)
- for the text posts, the code will search for 20 posts for these information : (id, date posted, timestamp, title, content, tags and note count.)
- I'll then write 2 CSV file
- Data in the first CSV file (tumblr_photo.csv) : 7 columns -- id, timestamp, captions, tags, url, dimensions, note count 
- Data in the second CSV file (tumblr_text.csv) : 7 columns -- id, date, timestamp, tags, content, note count

I relied on the Tumblr API Documentation to achieve these steps

Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing Tumblr's API to search and gather the following for a blog called indieteen.tumblr.com:
- the code will extract information such as the blog's name, number of updates, number of blog posts, number of likes and the url of the blog.
- I'll then write 1 CSV file
- Data in the CSV file: 5 columns -- blog's name, number updates, number blog posts, number likes, url
- 

I relied on the Tumblr API Documentation to achieve these steps
